Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components 

This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled by CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, edit profile & lastly the homepage. There are three different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

The styling is all handled via CSS.
